\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
An investigation was carried out to look for a suitable commercial replacement of the
currently available three-axis fluxgate magnetometers, LEMI (Laboratory of
Electromagnetic Innovations) 011B and 011T. This report
presents a list of currently available fluxgate magnetometers, offered by different
laboratories and institutions. The price list of the magnetometers
recommended by each company as suitable candidates to replace LEMI 011 are shown. 
\end{abstract}
\section*{Commercially Available Fluxgate Magnetometers}
The following subsections contain a list of fluxgate magnetometers available from 
different industries and laboratories.
\subsection*{LEMI Fluxgate Magnetometers}
LEMI was established in 2008 with the focus of development and production of high
quality electromagnetic (EM) sensors for the geophysical industry. Its located in
Lviv, Ukraine. A list of fluxgate magnetometer sensors available at the LEMI is shown
in Figure \ref{Lemi}\footnote{See \url{http://www.lemisensors.com/?q=fluxgate}}. Quotes
will be requested if the replacement of a LEMI product with another is necessary.

\subsection*{Bartington Instruments}
Bartington Instruments\footnote{See \url{http://www.bartington.com}} is located in 
Thorney Leys Business Park in Witney, near Oxford, England. They design and
manufacture high precision fluxgate magnetometers, gradiometers, magnetic
susceptibility instruments and associated data processing equipment. Their fluxgate
magnetometers and their specifications are listed in
Table \ref{bart} and Table \ref{bart2}. A quote was requested for best space qualified
fluxgate
magnetometers and suitable candidates to replace LEMI 011. Bartington recommended 
Mag648($\sim\pounds$600=R10422.06) or Mag566 ($\sim\pounds$390 = R6772.15) due to
their low power consumption. According to them, those 2 magnetometers are completely
sealed in resin but have not been pre-qualified for space-use. However, Mag566 has
been incorporated on CubeSat according to this link:
\url{http://www.bartington.com/news/mag566-in-satellite-for-ionosphere-study}.
\par
Spacemag (price starting from $\sim\pounds$5500 = R95504.75) has been pre-qualified for
space-use and includes components that can be found in different radiation hardened
ratings. ``However choosing those types of components has limited quite significantly
what is achievable in terms of size and power specification.''

\subsection*{Macintyre Electronic Design Associates (MEDA)}
MEDA \footnote{See \url{http://www.meda.com}} was founded in 1980 and it manufactures
instruments and sensors for measuring weak magnetic fields in the DC to 200 kHz
frequency range. MEDA is located in Dulles, VA., a suburb of Washington, D.C. In 1994,
MEDA entered the satellite magnetometer market when Schonstedt Instrument Company
(SICO) terminated their satellite magnetometer business.\\\\
MEDA offers the TAM-1 and TAM-2 series of three-axis fluxgate magnetometers. The basic
TAM-1 design has a long history of success in space and has been used on numerous
civilian and military satellites since the early 1970s. TAM-2 series is a low power
derivative of TAM-1 fluxgate magnetometer. The specifications of these magnetometers
are listed in Table \ref{MEDA}.\\\\
Their price and delivery depend on the required reliability of the parts and the
required testing (vibration, thermal cycle, etc.). The unit price can range from
USD80,000.00 to USD150,000.00 depending on the quality of the parts, testing
requirements, analysis requirements and quantity ordered. Delivery is normally nine to
twelve months. The sensors are under ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations)
restrictions with respect to selling and providing technical data, so an export license
from the US State Department is required.
